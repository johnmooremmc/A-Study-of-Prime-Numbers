Console Program in C++

I may revisit this program later on and refine the searching algorithm, 
as currently the program is searching through all values up to the desired number which is oviously inefficient

Next step would be to impliment within the algorithm, to ignore all values which include 2,4,6,8,0 as the placevalue last digit 
(instead of asking program to compute whether the number is even, as that would be another waste of memory)
(and 5 when there exists more than 1 digit in the number)
